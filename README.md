# Plant AR Assistant

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a mobile application to assist users in cultivating plants using Augmented Reality (AR) technology. The application will detect plant pots or designated areas on a windowsill for placing pots, track plant growth progress based on environmental factors, visualize plant development stages in AR, and provide functionalities for watering and irrigation. Additionally, the app will include notification features to remind users of watering schedules and achievements to encourage effective plant care.

## Features

1. **Plant Pot Detection**
    - The application detects plant pots or designated areas on a windowsill for placing pots.
    - Utilizes AR technology to identify physical objects like plant pots in the real environment.

## Planned Development

2. **Plant Growth Algorithm**
    - Implement a growth tracking algorithm based on environmental data such as time, light intensity, humidity, temperature, etc.
    - Visualize plant development stages in AR, enabling real-time observation of changes.

3. **Plant Growth Stage Changes**
    - Automatically adjust plant growth stages based on environmental conditions, potentially synchronized with weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to simulate wind, rain, etc., or measure brightness.
    - Interactive feature allowing users to observe plant changes in different development phases.

4. **Watering and Irrigation Functionality**
    - Monitor soil moisture and provide adequate watering over time, with user input adjustment.
    - Interactive user interface for adjusting the amount of water supplied to the plant.

5. **Notifications and Achievements**
    - Notification system sends reminders about watering schedules or other maintenance activities.
    - Implementation of an achievements system to motivate users to care for their plants and achieve cultivation goals.

## Technology Suggestions

- **Unity and ARCore (for Android):** Integration of Unity and ARCore for Android devices to merge the real environment with virtual objects, such as plant models.
